<b>Back to the December</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm so glad you made<br>
                    time to see me<br>
                    How's life? Tell me how's <br>
                    your family?<br>
                    I haven't seen them in <br>
                    a while<br><br>
                    
                    You've been good, <br>
                    busier than ever<br>
                    We small-talk, work <br>
                    and the weather<br>
                    Your guard is up and<br>
                     I know why<br><br>
                    
                    Because the last time<br>
                     you saw me is still <br>
                    burned in the back <br>
                    of your mind<br>
                    You gave me roses <br>
                    and I left them <br>
                    there to die<br><br>
                    
                    So this is me<br>
                    swallowing my pride<br>
                    Standing in front of you<br>,
                    saying, "I'm sorry for that night,"<br>
                    And I go back to<br>
                    December all the time<br><br>
                    
                    It turns out freedom<br>
                    ain't nothing but <br>
                    missing you<br>
                    Wishing I'd realized<br>
                     what I had when <br>
                    you were mine<br>
                    I'd go back to December,<br>
                    turn around and make<br>
                    it all right<br>
                    I go back to December<br>
                    all the time<br><br>
                    
                    These days I haven't <br>
                    been sleeping<br>
                    Staying up, playing back<br> 
                    myself leaving<br>
                    When your birthday<br>
                    passed and I didn't call<br><br>
                    
                    And I think about summer,<br>
                    all the beautiful times<br>
                    I watched you laughing<br>
                    from the passenger side<br>
                    And realized I loved you<br>
                    in the fall<br><br>
                    
                    And then the cold came,<br>
                    the dark days when fear<br>
                    crept into my mind<br>
                    You gave me all your love<br>
                    and all I gave you was "Goodbye"<br><br>
                    
                    So this is me <br>
                    swallowing my pride<br>
                    Standing in front of you, saying, <br>
                    "I'm sorry for that night."<br>
                    And I go back to <br>
                    December all the time<br><br>
                    
                    It turns out freedom ain't<br>
                    nothing but missing you<br>
                    Wishing I'd realized what I<br>
                    had when you were mine<br>
                    I'd go back to December,<br>
                    turn around and<br>
                    change my own mind<br>
                    I go back to<br>
                    December all the time<br><br>
                    
                    I miss your tanned skin,<br>
                    your sweet smile<br>
                    So good to me, <br>
                    so right And how<br>
                     you held me in<br>
                     your arms that<br>
                    September night:<br>
                    The first time you<br>
                    ever saw me cry<br><br>
                    
                    Maybe this is wishful thinking<br>
                    Probably mindless dreaming<br>
                    But if we loved again,<br>
                    I swear I'd love you right<br><br>
                    
                    I'd go back in time<br>
                    and change it but I can't<br>
                    So if the chain is on <br>
                    your door I understand<br><br>
                    
                    But this is me<br>
                    swallowing my pride<br>
                    Standing in front of you, <br>
                    saying, "I'm sorry for that night."<br>
                    And I go back to December<br><br>
                    
                    It turns out freedom ain't<br>
                     nothing but missing you<br>
                    Wishing I'd realized what <br>
                    I had when you were mine<br>
                    I'd go back to December,<br>
                    turn around and<br>
                    make it all right<br>
                    I'd go back to December,<br>
                    turn around and<br>
                    change my own mind<br><br>
                    
                    I go back to December<br>
                    all the time<br>
                    All the time
