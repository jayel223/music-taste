<b>Red</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street<br>-<br>
Faster than the wind,<br>passionate as sin,<br>ending so suddenly<br>--<br>
Loving him is<br>like trying to<br>change your mind
Once you're already<br>flying through the<br>free fall<br>(1 Second)<br>
Like the colors<br>in autumn, so<br>bright, just before<br>they lose it all<br><br>

Losing him was blue,<br>
like I'd never known<br>
Missing him was dark<br>
gray, all alone<br>
Forgetting him was<br>
like trying to know<br>
Somebody you never met<br>
But loving him was red<br>
Loving him was red<br><br><br>

Touching him was like<br>realizing all you ever wanted<br>
Was right there<br>in front of you<br>
Memorizing him was<br>as easy as knowing<br>all the words<br>
To your old<br>favorite song<br>
Fighting with him<br>was like trying<br>to solve a crossword<br>
And realizing<br>there's<br>no right answer<br>
Regretting him was<br>like wishing you never found out<br>
That love could<br>be that strong<br>

Losing him was<br>blue, like I'd never known
Missing him was<br>dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like<br>trying to know
Somebody you never<br>met
But loving<br>him was red
Oh, red<br>
Burning red<br>

Remembering him comes<br>in flashbacks and<br>echoes<br>
Tell myself it's<br>time now gotta let go<br>
But moving on from him<br>is impossible
When<br>I still see<br>it all in my head<br>
In burning red<br>
Burning, it was red<br>

Oh, losing him was blue,<br>like I'd never known<br>
Missing him was<br>dark gray, all alone<br>
Forgetting him<br>was like trying to know<br>
Somebody you<br>never met
'Cause loving<br>him was red
Yeah, yeah, red<br>
Burning red<br>

And that's why<br>he's spinning<br>'round in my head<br>
Comes back<br>to me, burning red<br>
Yeah,<br> yeah<br>
His love was like driving<br>a new Maserati down a<br>dead end street<br>
