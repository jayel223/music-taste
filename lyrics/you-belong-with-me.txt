<b>You Belong With Me</b>
<br>

<br>
You're on the phone<br>
with your girlfriend<br>
She's upset, she's<br>going off about<br>something that you said<br>
'Cause she doesn't<br>get your humor<br>like I do<br><br>

I'm in the room,<br>it's a typical<br>Tuesday night<br>
I'm listening to the<br>kind of music<br>she doesn't like<br>
And she'll<br>never know your<br>story like I do<br><br><br>

But she wears short skirts<br>
I wear T-shirts<br>
She's cheer captain<br>
And I'm on the bleachers<br>
Dreaming about the<br>
day when you wake<br>up and find<br>
That what you're looking for<br>has been here the whole time

If you could see<br>
That I'm the one<br>
Who understands you<br>
Been here all along<br>
So, why can't you see<br>
You belong with me<br>
You belong with me<br>
<br>
<br>
Walk in the streets<br>with you in your<br>worn-out jeans<br>
I can't help<br>thinking this is<br>how it ought to be<br>
Laughing on a<br>park bench<br>thinking to myself
"Hey, isn't<br>this easy?"

And you've<br>got a smile<br>
That could light<br>up this whole town<br>
I haven't<br>seen it in<br>a while<br>
Since she<br>brought you down<br>

You say you're<br>fine I know you<br>better than that<br>
Hey, what you doing<br>with a girl like that?<br>

She wears high heels<br>
I wear sneakers<br>
She's cheer captain<br>
And I'm on the bleachers<br>
Dreaming about the day<br>
when you wake up and find<br>
That what you're looking<br>
for has been here the whole time<br>

If you could see<br>
That I'm the one<br>
Who understands you<br>
Been here all along<br>
So, why can't you see<br>
You belong with me<br>

Standing by and<br>waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you<br>not know, baby?
You belong with me<br>
You belong with me<br>

Oh, I remember<br>you driving to my house<br>
In the middle of the night<br>
I'm the one<br>who makes you laugh<br>
When you know<br>you're 'bout to cry<br>
I know your<br>favorite songs<br>
And you tell<br>me about your dreams<br>
Think I know<br>where you belong<br>
Think I know <br>it's with me<br>

Can't you see<br>
That I'm the one<br>
Who understands you?<br>
Been here all along<br>
So, why can't you see<br>
You belong with me<br>

Standing by and<br>waiting at your backdoor<br>
All this time<br>how could you not know, baby?<br>
You belong with me<br>
You belong with me<br>

You belong with me<br>

Have you ever thought just maybe<br>
You belong with me?<br>
You belong with me<br>
