<br>
I'd never gone with the wind<br>
Just let it flow<br>
Let it take me where it wants to go<br>
'Til you open the door<br>
There's so much more<br>
I'd never seen it before<br><br>

I was trying to fly but I couldn't find wings<br>
But you came along and you changed everything<br><br>

You lift my feet off the ground<br>
You spin me around<br>
You make me crazier, crazier<br>
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes<br>
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier<br><br>

I've watched from a distance<br>
As you made life your own<br>
Every sky was your own kind of blue<br>
And I wanted to know<br>
How that would feel<br>
And you made it so real<br><br>

You showed me something that I couldn't see<br>
You opened my eyes and you made me believe<br><br>

You lift my feet off the ground<br>
You spin me around<br>
You make me crazier, crazier<br>
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes<br>
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier<br>

Baby, you showed me what living is for<br>
I don't wanna hide anymore<br><br>

You lift my feet off the ground<br>
You spin me around<br>
You make me crazier, crazier<br>
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes<br>
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier<br>
Crazier, crazier.<br>
