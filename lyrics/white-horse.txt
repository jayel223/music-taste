<br>
Say you're sorry<br>
That face of an angel<br>
Comes out just<br>when you need it to<br>
-<br>
-<br>
As I paced back and forth<br>all this time<br>
'Cause I honestly believed in you<br>
Holding on<br>
The days drag on<br>
Stupid girl<br>
I should have known,<br>I should have known<br><br>

That I'm not a princess,<br>this ain't a fairy tale<br>
I'm not the one<br>you'll sweep off her feet<br>
Lead her up the stairwell<br>
This ain't Hollywood,<br>this is<br>a small town<br>
I was a dreamer before<br>you went and<br>let me down<br>
-<br>
Now it's too late<br>for you and<br>your white horse<br>to come around<br><br>

Maybe I was na√Øve<br>
Got lost in your eyes<br>
And never<br>really had a chance<br>
My mistake, I didn't<br>know to be in love<br>
You had to fight to have the upper hand<br>
I had so many dreams<br>
About you<br>and me<br>
Happy endings<br>
Now I know<br><br><br>

That I'm not a princess,<br>this ain't a fairy tale<br>
I'm not the one<br>you'll sweep<br>off her feet
Lead her up<br>the stairwell<br>
This ain't Hollywood,<br>this is a small town<br>
I was a dreamer<br>before you went<br>and let me down<br>
Now it's too<br>late for you<br>and your white<br>horse to come around<br><br><br>

And there you<br>are on your knees<br>
Begging for<br>forgiveness, begging for me<br>
Just like I<br>always wanted but I'm so sorry<br><br><br>

'Cause I'm<br>not your<br>princess, this ain't a fairy tale<br>
I'm gonna<br>find someone<br>someday who might actually treat me well<br>
This is a<br>big world, that<br>was a small town<br>
There in<br>my rear view mirror<br>disappearing now<br>
And it's too late<br>for you and<br>your white horse<br>
Now it's too late<br>for you and<br>your white horse to catch me now<br>

Oh,<br>whoa,<br>whoa,<br>whoa<br>
Try and catch me now<br>
Oh, it's too late<br>
To catch me now<br>
